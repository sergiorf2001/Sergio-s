Welcome to my Online-Repository. 
I am currently uploading and updating the codes that I have used in my Theses and other subjects and projects. For instance, you can find:
  1. "ProgramasTFG Comentados": This are the programs that I created on my Physics Bacheor's Thesis. It contains codes that were used to calculate the eigenstates of the Graphene Nanoribbons, both finite and infinite length. In addition, some other programs regarding the representation of the analytical solutions that I provide on my Thesis. The codes are currently in Spanish, I am expecting to be able to change them to English as soon as possible. You can check my Thesis here https://digibuo.uniovi.es/dspace/handle/10651/72839?show=full&locale-attribute=en, but it is also in Spanish.
